# PasswordManager
Term Project at SJSU

This is a desktop password manager application. It allows user to safely store all of their usernames, passwords, and other relevant information from all of their various online accounts. Its key feature is that it requires the user to input a special key in order to decrypt all of their sensitive information, preventing unwanted people from gaining access to the users information. 

The UI and navigation were initially hand drawn. It was then implemenented using FXML, JavaFX, and a plugin called SceneBuilder.
